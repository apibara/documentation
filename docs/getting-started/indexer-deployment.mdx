# Deploying an indexer to production

This page will show you how to deploy an indexer.
To follow this tutorial, you will need a server with Docker installed.

We will deploy the following components:

 - **Etcd**: a distributed Key-Value store, it is used by Apibara to store the
   indexer's progress and to ensure only one instance of each indexer is
   running at the same time.
 - **Indexer**: the indexer you developed.

**Note:** for a production-grade deployment, you will need to deploy 3 or 5
Etcd instances on different machines to ensure liveness of the cluster.
If you don't want to manage the cluster yourself, you can use the Apibara
hosted service to deploy your indexers following all the best practices.


## The Etcd cluster

We start a single-node Etcd cluster. We use the [Bitnami etcd docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/etcd/) and disable authentication.
Data is persisted to the `etcd_data` volume.

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  etcd:
    image: docker.io/bitnami/etcd:3.5
    environment:
      ALLOW_NONE_AUTHENTICATION: yes
    volumes:
    - etcd_data:/bitnami/etcd
    ports:
    - 2379:2379

volumes:
  etcd_data:

```

## The Apibara indexer

Running the indexer simply requires to start the container and point it to the right script file.
We set three environment variables:

 - `AUTH_TOKEN`: the token used to authenticate with the DNA stream.
 - `PERSIST_TO_ETCD`: tell the indexer to persist its state to Etcd. Must contain the URL of the Etcd
 cluster previously created.
 - `SINK_ID`: the unique indexer id. This is used to resume indexing from where
   the indexer previously left off and to ensure only one copy of the indexer
   is running at any given time.

Let's add the following snippet to the existing `docker-compose.yml` file, just below the `etcd` service.

```yaml
  indexer:
    image: quay.io/apibara/cli:0.1
    depends_on:
    - etcd
    restart: always
    command:
    - run
    - /data/script.js
    volumes:
    - ${PWD}/script.js:/data/script.js
    environment:
      PERSIST_TO_ETCD: http://etcd:2379
      SINK_ID: my-indexer
      AUTH_TOKEN: dna_<xxx>
```

Notice that in this example the indexer source code is contained in a single file named `script.js`.
If your indexer's code is split across multiple files, you can mount the source
directory in the container.


**Note**: This example uses the `apibara/cli` image which contains the
`apibara` CLI tool together with all the built-in sinks. For this reason this
image is quite large (almost 200MB), you can also use a sink-specific Docker
image (named `apibara/sink-*`) to reduce your container start time.


## Running the indexer

You can now start the indexer with `docker compose up`.

Notice that if you restart the indexer, it may take a while (up to one minute)
before it starts because it needs to acquire the Etcd lock.
This is done on purpose: running two instances of the same indexer will result
in duplicate data inserted in your database or sent to webhooks.
